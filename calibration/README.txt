Calibration routine:

1.	Configure and generate a set of calibration poses with "set_calibration_poses.m"
2.	Use the poses to move the robot and capture images with both cameras with "capture.out"
3.	Find the camera locations in the world frame and save the camera matrices with "world_calibration.m"
